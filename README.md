# RiteShop (Frontend)

**RiteShop** is an online store like Amazon, Jumia, Takealot etc. On **RiteShop**, purchases can either be made directly by customer online or via a sales agent through the a progressive web application. The key features of the app should be able to be accessed offline in case the sales agent has no mobile signal.

Both customers or sales agent can browse, filter and search through the product catalog to find items. They can then add items to their carts and the quantities of items in the cart can be updated. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
